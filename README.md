# Vehicle-repair-industry-project-
🔧 Performed data cleaning, EDA, and root cause analysis on real-world vehicle repair datasets using Python. 📊 Identified key failure trends like cosmetic defects, leaks, and BEV-specific issues. ✅ Delivered insights to improve design, maintenance, and reduce operational costs
🚗 AxionRay Data Analysis Report – Task 1, 2 & 3 Summary
🔍 Objective:
To clean, explore, and analyze multi-source vehicle service datasets to identify recurring failures, cost patterns, and improvement opportunities across platforms and repair types.

📊 Task 1: Vehicle Repair Dataset Analysis
Actions Taken: Cleaned missing & inconsistent data, handled outliers, standardized text, and visualized trends using Python.

Key Insights:

60% of failures were cosmetic (peeling, loose stitching), and 30% electrical (mostly in heated modules).

BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) incur higher repair costs, especially due to Super Cruise system issues.

Quality issues appeared more frequently in export regions like the Middle East.

Recommendations: Improve leather quality, strengthen QC for cold-weather components, and offer extended warranties.

🔧 Task 2: Root Cause Analysis on Work Order & Repair Data
Actions Taken: Cleaned numeric formats, handled missing & negative values, translated German text, and analyzed repair trends.

Key Insights:

Most frequent failures: Leaks, oil loss, sensor errors, and incomplete failure documentation.

High-cost repairs linked to mechanical breakdowns like engine replacements.

Root Causes:

Poor O-ring quality, weak documentation, and sensor malfunctions.

Recommendations: Standardize service logs, use durable sealing materials, update sensor firmware, and reinforce stress-prone components.

🔗 Task 3: Data Integration & Advanced Analysis
Actions Taken: Merged work order and repair datasets using composite keys, followed by visual EDA (heatmaps, trends).

Key Insights:

"Leak" failures dominate across equipment; "APPL" has high oil loss; "SPRAYS" faces sensor-related errors.

Costly months do not always align with high order volume → poor planning.

Labor cost is highly correlated with part cost (r = 0.72); electronic components yield the highest margins.

Recommendations:

Preventive Maintenance before seasonal spikes (spring, summer).

Improve inventory of leak-prone parts and electronics.

Automate technician documentation to reduce unresolved errors.

✅ Final Outcome:
All three tasks uncovered actionable insights across design, quality, operations, and maintenance. Leveraging this analysis can lead to reduced downtime, better part planning, improved margins, and higher customer satisfaction.
